Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users, typically through messaging or voice interfaces. They can handle customer inquiries, provide product recommendations, and even process transactions directly within the chatbot. AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the simulation of intelligent behavior in machines that can perceive their environment, reason, learn, and take action to achieve specific goals. In the context of digital marketing, AI is used to analyze customer behavior and patterns to provide personalized recommendations and improve the overall customer experience.
